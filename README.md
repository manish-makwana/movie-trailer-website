MOVIE TRAILER WEBSITE
=====================

This project is for Udacity's full stack nanodegree - P#1 movie trailer
website project. It demonstrates using Python to build a class that stores
information about some of my favourite films, then dynamically generates a
website that displays the movies and allows quick viewing of their trailers.

SETUP
=====

1. Clone the repository to somewhere on your computer.

2. If needed, install python on your computer. See

	 https://www.python.org/downloads/

3. Open a console in the repository folder, then run `python movies.py`.
	 The website will open in your default web browser.

4. You can re-open the website later by double clicking on the 
	 `fresh_tomatoes.html` file that was automatically generated by the program
	 in step 3.

ABOUT THE CODE
==============

The class used to store data about the movies, called `Movie`, is in 
`movies.py`. Objects are created with this class in the same file. The code 
for generating the HTML is found in `rotten_tomatoes.py`, which was provided
by Udacity as a starting point for the project. I have made some minor
modifications to insert more information on each film on the website.

`movies.py` is self-executing, however the code is called through a `main()`
function to provide compatibility with pydoc or importing as a module.

LICENCE
=======

This program is released under the MIT Licence. See `LICENCE.md` for the
full details.
